To connect seperate java script files, do  the following:

In the main js file, add the code:

import "object" from "./jsfile.js";


then in the extra js file put:

export default "object";

(Don't use the "" on the object)

and in HTML do:

<script type="module" src="jsfile.js></script>
<script type="module" src="jsfile2.js></script>

in the <head>

no need to use defer or async because once set to moduler,
they automaticly getted defered

best to use with class's as a framework for objects, rather than calling objects from modules
